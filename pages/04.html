        <p>Highlights from the interviews:</p>

        <div class="highlights">
        <!-- PABLO -->
            <p><span class="highlight">"What I really want to is change the neoliberal capitalist values of that into post-capitalist mutualist values. How to do that is the project. And the thing is that I'm working with organizations at the intersection of software for alternative economies and self-organization." - Pablo</span></p>
            <p><span class="highlight">"I'm trying to make sense of all of that mess with a narrative that is easy to explain, that people can relate to, and also trying to map a bunch of projects in these spaces like distributed economies, distributed computing, alternative economies — and using Pocas like as an excuse to integrate projects and ideas from these projects." - Pablo</span></p>
            <p><span class="highlight">"So, you know that most of the work that goes into website is care work. It’s just caring for it and nourishing it. So that's the stage with Pocas." - Pablo</span></p>
            <p><span class="highlight">"So in a way use fictioning and speculation as a serious way of developing systems. So what do we want to see? Let's build the systems for that, hoping that we create sort of the infrastructure for the life we want, basically." - Pablo</span></p>
            <p><span class="highlight">"How do you show something that is primarily a website?" - Pablo</span></p>
            <p><span class="highlight">"I really like the attitude you have towards it because it's more generative. I just gave up. I just assume that my websites are going to be broken." - Pablo</span></p>
            <p><span class="highlight">"I'm exploring — this is not very developed in the work — using marketing as a strategy against capitalism. You're like fighting a monster, right? So this attention economy is absolutely relentless. So you have to be flashy. Post-capitalism has to be flashy and efficient and nice…" - Pablo</span></p>
            <p><span class="highlight">"I'm really personally very bothered about depictions of the future that are super clean, you know, when you see these beautiful building with greenery and it’s new and I'm like: who was living there before? Was a community displaced for this utopia? What do these images imply, right?" - Pablo</span></p>
            <p><span class="highlight">"Me personally, I’m more excited about peer-to-peer forms of local money first. So with your community, with people you trust and you encounter face to face, you don't necessarily need a global blockchain. You don't need to manage state globally. You can have a local chain." - Pablo</span></p>

            <!-- BIANCA -->
            <p><span class="highlight">"Yes. I thought of more literally bringing the elements of a shore into the exhibition space, like water and sand. Technology allows for a lighter experience while still capturing the ritual’s essence, in my opinion." - Bianca</span></p>
            <p><span class="highlight">"How can digital experiences reinforce lasting positive associations in people towards their environment, even after leaving the exhibition space?" - Bianca</span></p>

            <!-- SARA -->
            <p><span class="highlight">"There’s a phenomenon of cybersquatting, you know it? When scammers or internet entrepreneurs purposely buy domain names resembling existing brand names written with mistakes and typos (like gooogle.com). It is expected that users will click on your address and this will bring you some profit." - Sara</span></p>
            <p><span class="highlight">"So I started to think about the metaphor of the domain and that maybe I can transfer my rights of the domain to someone who deserves it. Someone who thinks about what to do with the state, the owner of the state or someone who works for the state, like citizens, laborers, I don't know." - Sara</span></p>
            <p><span class="highlight">"Because there was some discussion about AI in the EU Parliament... They recently took a serious look at the term "electronic person" - how to define them, how to make them more responsible, and so on. And maybe we'll need some sort of entity for these algorithms because they're going to get smarter and smarter." - Sara</span></p>
            <p><span class="highlight">"For this project, I interviewed a designer and a researcher of network culture, Lukas Engelhardt. I asked him how to hack the system in order to transfer the rights to AI. And he answered that it’s potentially possible to hack the server and then re-write the rights. So it's almost impossible, but potentially you can do it. You can symbolically transfer it.</span></p>
            <p><span class="highlight">"Domain means controlled area by the owner within. Domains can be disputed territory, like in a real political map." - Sara</span></p>
            <p><span class="highlight">"There is a concept in Russia still developing now, which is the concept of sovereign internet, which is a concept of an isolated system." - Sara</span></p>
            <p><span class="highlight">"Because during the interview with Lukas Engelhardt told you about the web researcher, he mentioned that when we’re talking about an ownership of a domain, we’re speaking about controlling the domain." - Sara</span></p>

            <!-- CARRIE -->
            <p><span class="highlight">"…And how, as a society, we're making play productive. Play is such a joyful, imaginative and freeing type of human experience, but increasingly we’re seeing the commodification of it." - Carrie</span></p>
            <p><span class="highlight">"I can embed interesting details in the virtual space that signal this idea of child’s play, but also really push the idea of how these organizations, research centers are packaging childhood experiences. - Carrie</span></p>

            <!-- LING -->
            <p><span class="highlight">"So I do believe that there is an importance in the use of online presence. But for me, in my practice, I always prefer to use that as a tool to enable people to meet in person." - Ling</span></p>
            <p><span class="highlight">"What I've noticed from audience interactions is that there's is a much more complex nuance that people have of the game, more than I expected. I think that's actually really nice to hear when people are asking very complex question about democracy. That's something that I find really interesting from this project that people put a lot of meaning into it, which I think is much more important than having it scripted to the very bits that you want people to experience everything the way you want to." - Ling</span></p>

            <!-- MAISA -->
            <p><span class="highlight">"I’m exploring how, for me and a lot of cyberfeminist coders, a glitch is an opportunity to change the whole system, the structure and the politics of what you're building. But in the traditional sense of web development, according to the syntax and the semantics, the belief is that you have to fix it, you have to hide the glitch. If there are too many glitches, we have maintenance mode, so we put the veil on top of the website until things are fixed or finished. So this idea of work in progress…there’s a lot of praise around it. But when you look at how many web projects or game projects implement showcasing that the work is in progress, you don't see so many examples." - Maisa</span></p>
