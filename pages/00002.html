        <!-- started in the 90s -->
        <!-- perhaps by now we're all familiar with the syberfeminist history -->
        <!-- massive online movement of women self-publishing their 'blogs' -->
        <!-- at the beginning, these blogs were online versions of their diaries -->
        <!-- but then became an amazing cultural theory -->
        <!-- a lot of guys were undermining it by calling it "grafitti art walls" -->
        <!-- today, there are a lot of artists and tech entreprenaeurs trying to revive this aesthetic (messthetic) -->
        <!-- but to me, they make sense in their time, as a response to the centralization of the web; it helped women connect-->
        <!-- but we have different views on connection now, and it's usually SKEPTICAL -->
        <!-- so what websites are good examples of present moment? -->
