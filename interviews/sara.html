            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I do research about the basic human relationship with technology, but specifically web design as a translation of human behaviors, senses, and meaning. I'm also specifically interested in the division of roles in that domain. How do web developers perceive humans and how do they further program them as users through code? It's very basic, transactional. And recently, since I'm doing a fellowship in Berkley, I'm focusing on how AI sees the user, while working with AI. I’m interested in perception of what a human is and how it's further programmed through technology, but specifically through web development. So I thought that, you know, we can all talk about websites, even if that revolves around the topic of social media platforms…We're all users and to a certain extent we do depend on these tools and especially when it comes to art creation. We heavily depend on digital archives that preserve the cultural heritage in order to remain, or to exist basically. I think what I'm exploring for this context is: Can all of your works, from all the STRP artists, exist without the festival? And what would that look like? If there is a digital component to the hybrid work, then why do we need the festival. I think, obviously, that we need it, but if we imagine that we don't think the festival, what would the cost of that work be? But to begin with the initial questions, can you describe what your project is about?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Sara</b><br>
            The idea of the project changed a little bit during the research. My initial was…I have a domain which I bought. It’s called prussia.tech. There’s a phenomenon of cybersquatting, you know it? When people make mistakes and typos with purpose. Or when you buy a lot of domains with typos (like gooogle) and you can make a profit, as an owner of the domain. I'm originally from Russia. Prussia and Russia sounds like a cybersquatting project. The beginning of it was 2020, hardcore political crush — at the beginning of the war, I got a lot of discount promotions from the Russian sovereigns, IT companies to buy the domain in the Russian zone, because their reputation of the country went down. When the country, or the state, makes crucial mistakes, the price of assets goes to the hell and you can buy a chunk of the country. But I couldn't buy 
            <a href="http://prussia.tech/" target="_blank"> http://prussia.tech/</a> because it was taken. There was no domain back then. But then I got it for a reasonable price. So I just got it, and was then thinking a lot about what to do with it because, you know, it's like you just have an asset with an ironic name. The origin of domain’s word is like an embryo of the state, like a start or era — it’s from medieval times. It's like a prototype of the state. So I started to think about the metaphor of the domain and that maybe I can transfer my rights of the domain to someone who deserves it. Someone who thinks about what to do with the state, the owner of the state or someone who works for the state, like citizens, laborers, I don't know. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Somebody who wants to maintain it basically.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Sara</b><br>
            I was thinking about the infrastructure of the Web — it can entail water, wires, AI, algorithms, bots, digital laborers/workers. Since there is a lot of discussion about it AI in EU parliament…they recently seriously considered the term of electronic personhood, electronic personality — how to charge them, how to make them more responsible, and so on. And that maybe we need a kind of entity for these specific algorithms because they're going to be smarter and smarter. So my first idea was to transfer my rights because I'm the owner. Actually not the owner, but a registrant. You register the domain then prolong it but it’s not forever. You can’t really own a domain, but that’s a topic for another discussion. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            What does it take to own it? Do you need to be in charge of the physical server?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Sara</b><br>
            The domain is just a name in the nomenclature, or the book of registration. It’s just a list of data. There is an American corporation that established in the system, but it's more foundational and implementing the international standard. They have meetings and summits about what to do with domains because they also have…not only English language exists on the Internet. There’s Arabic keyboard, Cyrillic, etc. Also, it’s very patriotic to promote your language on internet, because it’s very inconvenient for international communication. But for domestic consumers, it works well. You can use your keyboard with your local alphabet, but there’s a system that converts, for example, Cyrillic, or German umlauts into standard form. It’s an another interesting topic revolving around names…
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            It's linguistics.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Sara</b><br>
            It's all the others. Without the name of the doman, it's just numbers and digits. Anyway. I was thinking about how to transfer the rights, symbolically or not. I started to think that maybe there was a loophole, that can hack the legal system. I was thinking about another entity who are not fully humans, for example like LGBT people. In different countries you're not completely human because you have oppressed rights. For example, in some countries, gay marriage is illegal, but you can share your property, your children…So then you crate an emulation of this marriage. Historically, for example, in USA, there are two cases, one being that you could adopt your lover, which was the law before America decided to legalize it. But that was weird because you could have sexual relationship with your adopted…Or you can imitate marriage with any kind of legal connection with your partner. You can make a business together, you can buy property together, so the property connects you. These are exemplary loopholes for LGBT people. But minors/children are also not fully humans. Everything is not allowed for minors — no property, they can’t open the bank account, even register themselves on Instagram (according to Putin). And that goes against transitioning. If you’re fully human, everyone can have sex with you. Back in the history, minors up until the age of 14/16/18 were not even human. Or slaves back then. Animals too. But there are several cases in the history. If you’re a rich person who has a favorite cat or a dog…you can establish a trust fund, which has a director or a manager who controls the money. But technically it's a trust fund for your non-human friend. Anyway, there was a search on the way on how to symbolically go around the law. Yeah. For this project, I interviewed a designer and a researcher of the web and asked him how to hack the system in order to transfer the rights to AI. And he answered that it’s potentially possible to hack the server and then re-write the rights. So it's almost impossible, but potentially you can do it. You can symbolically transfer it. So then I started to discover more and more, which I didn't even include in the video because it's a lot. But I think I will write an article or an essay about it, for Institute of Network Culture, for example. 
        </p>

            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            They would love it for sure.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Sara</b><br>
            …Otherwise a long movie about websites is really hard to consume.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I love your research. Remembering it from before, I thought: Wow, this is such an interesting story, but I can't visualize what's going to be the material aspect of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Sara</b><br>
            I suffer now because you need to make poetic, visual stuff…It’s fun but I didn't think about it, because I just operate with facts. I started to discover more information about the metaphor of the domain itself. A domain is the metaphor of the real domain territories, or states. Domain means controlled area controlled by the owner within. Domains can have disputed domains, like in a real political map. I found several cases — not for video, but definitely for text demonstration. One is a story about the doman which called Deutschland dot eu. Governments just took it from a private tech company, German one, and they had legal disputes for two years. The German government really wanted it because it was time before an election…So the domain with significant and capricious name work like soft power. Alot of good names were taken back then, because it was the 90s. People who were in tech got domains like game dot com. It’s a good asset. Deutschland dot de is about Deutschland. But the owner was a private company. So I found all these articles titled “Who owns Deutschland?”. So two years of legal disputes and legal stuff don’t make sense for us because we register the domain and we get it. What’s the problem? Another case is also very strange. I was thinking about disputed domains. I typed in some unrecognised countries like [ name of the country ] dot com. Speaking about another war between Azerbaijan and Armenia, which recently ended…And they took the territory that's called Artsakh in Armenia, and Nagorno Karabakh in Azerbaijan. If you put on Google Artsakh dot com, it transfers you to Karabakh dot com <a href="https://www.zerbaijan.com/var/qarabagh.htm" target="_blank">(https://www.zerbaijan.com/var/qarabagh.htm)</a> That’s only one step of the strange story.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Wait, is it like a redirect that changes the URL as well?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Sara</b><br>
            Yeah, it’s a redirect. So the website redirects to Azerbaijan's site which portrays only one side of the war in English. No-one knows who is the owner of both domains…It was like several years after the Soviet Union fell apart. They had a lot of disputes about the borders and so on. So this story about the domains flags the situation on the ground. It’s kind of like a virtual level of projection. It's so strange. But I didn't put it in the room because it's really hard to explain.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            It's such an interesting discovery. That’s why I'm interested in the translation from physical to digital. Usually it happens in a very literal sense which creates some kind of standard web development syntax or whatever. I'm always interested in other forms of representing something. I wish to read an article about this because, you know, as users we don't necessarily pay attention to the URL changing. There's not much literacy around these things, unless you're doing research like you are, or unless you know how the web technically works and that there's the possibility to redirect from website to another. Users usually take these things for granted, so this is such a great research discovery.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Sara</b><br>
            You focus on this how these details if you're really rational. In Russia now it’s getting harder and harder, especially with internet. There is a concept in Russia still developing now, which is the concept of sovereign internet, which is a concept of isolated system. Authorities and the people who are in charge have meetings with people from Iran and China now because they have technologies, especially China, how to isolate…There is a bunch of oppositional Russian media in exile. Recently, more and more attacks appeared on the web domains of specific medias. And these media channels make a lot of mirrors, like millions of mirrors. It’s easy to visualise broken mirrors. What that means, for example, is that you buy a lot of domain names, maybe you can generate this even…And then you’re sending from this site to your mirror or opposite. Maybe they have like an automatic system of algorithms and it creates an endless war. A chain of crashing mirrors. It’s part of the problem of censorship. When we're speaking about censorship, we're speaking about a lot of tools. For example, good censorship is to block someone. For specific domains, you are not only against the main server, but the address. If you have authority, you block the address. The thing is that you can buy more addresses. But your server is another thing.  Hosting is just a redirection. That’s the war with domains. You can also speak about the propaganda of domestic names and domestic nationalism. I noticed that you have your website in dot eu zone.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Exactly.
        </p>
        <p><i>[ A 2 minute chunk of conversation flagged as TMI for publicity ]</i></p>
        <p>
            <b>Sara</b><br>
            What I found also like advertising campaigns in the domain because it’s not super old, it’s relatively new. You can register dot eu if you’re not in Europe. They have restrictions, like China. It's quite hard to get a Chinese domain. You need proxy people and companies. Some zones are under restrictions. Like for foreign people or people from outside. For example, you can show the proof that you work in the zone, area, country, city. I mean it's quite rare but it still exists. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I wonder if those regulations are leaning more towards business or the national pride…Do you have to prove in a way that the domain is almost like your passport, that is that you come from a specific country. Or do you have to do it because you have business, and for the the business to thrive it has to be within a certain national territory…
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Sara</b><br>
            It's mostly for business. For example, there are domains with dot Asia and dot Africa that promote local initiatives. I also saw a promotion campaign…Speaking further, I told you about my initial idea of asking some specialist if it’s even possible to transfer my domain to non-human such as AI. Then I started more and more to dig the information about how close the internet domain to the real domain is. I started to think more about the difference between ownership and control. Because during the interview with the guy I told you about, the web researcher, he mentioned that there was…when we’re talking about a seller owning a domain, we’re speaking about controlling the domain. I almost started to think about that control in Russia, also in political terms. The state has monopoly for control. And then I started to think more specifically about the role of the state and the entity and the problem of control. I was trying to find the transformation and I found very good video on the internet. Maybe you heard about it two years ago, just after the war in Ukraine started, the Netherlands held a huge international summit called Responsible AI in military domain. It was very Dutch style: fancy, expensive, with entertainment. They also collaborated with Rijksmuseum. There were a lot of people from military domain and from different countries. Yeah. There were more than 800 representatives from different countries. It's like real international summit. They published two videos from the summit and it's fascinating because the main topic was how we can reduce the harm because we’re in the war and how we can do it is more or less clear. In contemporary wars, there’s a lot of dirt and damage…So how to be more accurate…there were some people, like specialists who work with AI in the military domain. For example, one guy told about human-machine teaming. I was thinking, okay, AI has no rights because the initiative about electronic personhood was just an idea. It doesn't work now. There was no personhood. But you, as a state, or as a political entity, you recruit AI for your national interests. For the war, for example. But you don’t grant them citizenship or personhood. But you hire them. It’s like subject without subjectivity. I mean, that's a nonsense.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            That's insane.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Sara</b><br>
            I remember this story from medieval times — animal trials. Some happened in medieval Germany and medieval France. There are several cases of pigs or insects that make damage on someone's property. And then there are several trials. What to do with this specific pig? Punish. In this case, pig has no personhood, but when it damages something, it has to answer for it. It’s an imbalance of duties and rights in which you have only duties. So of course, when you’re speaking about AI, you’re only speaking about the metaphor because there is no real intelligence in artificial intelligence. I mean, it’s a advanced algorithm. Maybe in the future, it's going to be more advanced. Who will be in charge of its decisions? So these are all ethical problems. There is no intention, but there is agency anyway. And agency doesn’t mean that you have a soul. It's also about animism. It also points to this problem, maybe new types of animism. It fits to the problem of control and problems like national interest because, in state capitalism, speaking from the view of animism, everything has anima/soul, but everything is equally oppressed by the authorities. 
            You have your personality. My table has personality. AI has personality. We all equally have the right to exist, but we’re all equally oppressed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Cool. That's such an amazing project. You have a lot of material!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Sara</b><br>
            Yeah! I tried to contact people from different Internet communities, for example, there are a lot of communities around the identity called Objectum — having a romantic and sexual connection with objects. and animates objects. I was asking some people on the forums about how do they deal with rights because your partner has no rights and they're really depressed. They’re introverts, you know. The huge demographic of this community is teenagers, queer teenagers. One person explained their relationship with a very nice pen. A posh, fancy pen. And another person was in relationship with the chair. And there is a special model of this chair, so this person was in a relationship with this special model of this chair.
