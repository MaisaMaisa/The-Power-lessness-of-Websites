            You’re based in California, did you say?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Yeah, I'm currently here in L.A., but I was based in Amsterdam for ten years. I moved here for studies. I'm finishing my masters at the California Institute of the Arts. I started working with Nadine last summer, so maybe you remember me from the kickoff meeting briefly. We were planning to do this bigger project, which would be a website that collects the processes of all the artists’ development of their works and also in anticipation to the festival. I'm now working with Nikita and Joanne on a smaller scale project than the research that I initially started with Nadine. It's going to be in the format of the panel discussion. I'm interested…since I'm a web developer and a writer about technology, in the digital aspect of the hybrid artwork, which obviously doesn't exclude talking about the physical. And I'm so happy that you are joining me because I want to make it accessible also to artists who don't have the digital component of their work or the virtual representation. I believe that it's impossible to not think about the representation and aesthetic gesture in that sense, because eventually the work ends up on the pages of the STRPS's website. So thank you so much for finding time and for willing to participate. I'm happy to have you on board.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Ling</b><br>
            Thanks for having me. Is the panel discussion going to be remote or online?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            It's going to be in person. Are you going to be there?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Ling</b><br>
            I'm leaving on the 12th.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Okay, so we can still do the digital archive. So the idea is to conduct the interviews which I will transcribe and edit, then put them in this digital archive that I will present during the panel discussion while introducing the artists who are joining me. And in that sense, the website is going to be hybrid itself. It will also help me speak on stage and if you just see it as a standalone in the context of Internet and amongst other websites, it won't make much sense. It needs the human to be activated. Since it has to be a bit clear for the website, we can start with the initial questions. Can you describe what your project is about?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Ling</b><br>
            The project that I'm showing in the festival is called Playing Democracy, which is actually a project that I've done in Barbican three years ago. It's basically revolving around a game of politics, which is a game that's pretty popular online — Pong, which I'm sure everyone has played in one way or another. And the idea is to use a game of Pong to explore principles of democracy as you are playing with each other. The idea is that this play is a physical set up. I think that you could translate it into an online setup easily, but for this version it’s just a bigger vision of the physical setup. So the physical set up consists of four players that control four panels in the Pong game and is tracked by a camera tracking system that's tracking the movement. So you have the use of body movement to participate in the game. And each time one side of the players win a point, they get to change a rule in the game that is based around physical democracy, in which it changes the game environment and affects the chance of you winning the game or the chance of you not surviving in the game. In the game dynamic it’s quite interesting because you do have this type of game system where you get to change the rule. Whereas in other game types the rules and the goal are always inherent. A player has to play based on the rules. So the idea is that you really look into the game dynamism as well. And so in this version, the idea is that the principle it comes down to is really simple principle of democracy, which is the founding principle of it. So things to do with, for example, accountability, freedom of speech, human rights, equality, fairness, and how you use those principles to then map onto the game environment in a way that makes the audience understand simple things. So, for example, it could be as simple as: if you are in a very unequal environment, your paddle might be smaller than the players on the opposite end. So you can understand the idea of fairness easily. I want for the audience to immerse themselves in this game and through the game, simple game of Pong. I think the interesting thing is that once you get off the game, you start to really inspect how other people play the game. That's when the thing is interesting, you start thinking about how participation affects the way people intertwine with each other and also how society is structured around participation and what are the rules that enable people to participate with each other. And to which point does it break with when no one wants to participate in this.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I love that. How do you think that the context of Netherlands will receive the game or just the context of STRP? If, as you say, the very basic qualities of democracy are to be learned, I can immediately think of how differently it would work in the context of Eastern Europe versus Western Europe…
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Ling</b><br>
            I think it's interesting. I have actually been showing this in the UK mainly where the conversation has always been in relation to Brexit and this idea of democracy being broken. So I've never done it in the Netherlands before, but I've done it in Belgium. I think it depends on the audience because I think that, first of all, the people going to that festival are slightly different. So I'm kind of keen for the festivals, the STRP festival audience, because I think that the outcome that came was a more critical eye to tech. So I'll be super curious in terms of just how they see the game environment and how it gets people's thinking about complex question.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            And you mentioned that you didn't find the funding to convert it into the digital realm or turn it into a game. Is there any other reason why you decided to first go for the physical? I know you have a background in architecture, so I'm assuming that's also why you prefer the physical. But is there something more to it?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Ling</b><br>
            Like you said, I think the first reason is because I'm an architect and I prefer doing in-person installations as much as I can. I also have a background in web development. So a lot of projects that I’ve done involve online presence as well, where it gets the world to collaborate remotely with the idea that they then physically come together to build something together.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            That's cool.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Ling</b><br>
            <span class="highlight">So I do believe that there is an importance in the use of online presence. But for me, in my practice, I always prefer to use that as a tool to enable people to meet in person.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I love that.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Ling</b><br>
            When I was thinking about online version, it was actually during COVID time, I was curious about exploring whether you can create something like an online version? But it did start getting more and more complex. That's why there was a question on funding that comes in because, how does, for example, if there are only two players, how do they communicate with each other in a way that enabled them to collaborate? So it’s not just a Pong game that you play online, right? So how do we create this whole conversation between the players in a way that is natural as the in real person? Because it's actually quite complex to think about that minus other stuff that needs to happen in real time to get players to play in real time, I put that aside with thinking that, at some point I will do this.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            That makes sense. I make websites usually. I never dove into making games but I worked with artists who create virtual realities where there's a possibility for multi players. And in my experience or through my observations, they do need festivals. They need the physical promotion in order for their game to be played because otherwise it just gets lost in the sea of million other games. So in that sense, if you're opting for a platform like New Art City, for example, which is a bit more curated, it’s very hard for it to be perceived as an educational tool, or an art tool that has an educational purpose, and not just as the game that has been commodified. So I love that you have that as a priority. I did my BA in Architectural Design in Amsterdam, but I didn't pursue it further because I thought digital space was easier.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Ling</b><br>
            It is complex, no?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Yes! It has to pass so many levels in the physical sense. Just starting from thinking about designing a building and how many laws are part of the design…that’s when I was like, no, my life is too precious for that…but also because other people could do it better. It surely wasn’t my call. Can you tell me a bit about the history of the project? Did you have many iterations? In what state is it now?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Ling</b><br>
            Currently I’m doing the coding for the game environment. Historically, it was first launched in Barbican three years ago, right before the COVID lockdown. It was the most unfortunate thing. You spend three months in Barbican, setting up, and in two days it shut down. But okay, I thought, that’s not bad because I think it was supposed to be up for three months initially, but it went on until August. But the problem was that I didn't get much of the audience coming, or as much as I would like to. So that's why I was really wanting to do more of it. There, it was a much simpler system as well. Now, I’m trying to get everything set up and then designing the game environment. I'm kind of doing all the back end and stuff. I'm kind of stuck in thinking what's the programming of the game environment, which I think is going to be the fun part because that's where the complexity comes, when you have multiple players. I have the basic principle in the game set up and I’m just trying to get it to code so that it works and making it robust.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Are you planning to launch the virtual game during the festival as well? Or is that for the next iteration of the project?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Ling</b><br>
            Probably the next iteration. This is small building which looks at what happens if there’s four players playing and what can you get from that. It's a shame though, I wish I knew that the panel is taking place earlier because I could have stayed for another day. I just didn't know what was going on.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            It would be so good if you joined the panel discussion. Maybe we can accommodate something virtual…Can you share some feedback that you got from users who tested the game and who played the game, and also how that feeds into the next iteration of the development?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Ling</b><br>
            I think the interesting thing about this project for me is that most of the projects I did are quite complex in the kind of the structuring of the participation. I'm very clear in terms of what's going to happen. Everything is kind of scripted in a sense. And this project for me feels like it turns out to be the simplest, where I have a simple idea at hand. <span class="highlight">What I've noticed from audience interactions is that there's is a much more complex nuance that people have of the game, more than I expected. I think that's actually really nice to hear when people are asking very complex question about democracy. That's something that I find really interesting from this project that people put a lot of meaning into it, which I think is much more important than having it scripted to the very bits that you want people to experience everything the way you want to.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            That was going to be my next question, if there's any, which obviously sounds like there is some — primarily in the conversation, room for spontaneity? I’m curious if there's any spontaneity in terms of glitches…Did something happen during the game where you were like Oh fuck, this was not designed for that to happen and that you had to either fix, or adjust, or something like that?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Ling</b><br>
            I think most of the glitches, I mean the real, obvious glitches we resolved in the first version. Sometimes I see a cache issue when the board doesn't understand…
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I think that in the art context, people are forgiving.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Ling</b><br>
            If it is online, it needs to be more tested to make sure that it works properly.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            When I started my web development journey…and I usually work with archives, mainly web design and content management systems. And in the beginning, obviously, I had a lot of glitches on all of my websites and I was always really shocked how my friends, who I genuinely asked for feedback on my design, would just give me a list of things that didn't work — while I was super proud of this website, you know? Then I thought wow, on internet, people are unforgiving. You can't even expect your friends to be generous about what you build because…that’s what I'm studying in my research…the idea of perfection is embedded in web design. <span class="highlight">I’m exploring how, for me and a lot of cyberfeminist coders, a glitch is an opportunity to change the whole system, the structure and the politics of what you're building. But in the traditional sense of web development, according to the syntax and the semantics, the belief is that you have to fix it, you have to hide the glitch. If there are too many glitches, we have maintenance mode, so we put the veil on top of the website until things are fixed or finished. So this idea of work in progress…there’s a lot of praise around it. But when you look at how many web projects or game projects implement showcasing that the work is in progress, you don't see so many examples.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Ling</b><br>
            Interesting! I've just finished building a website for my new company. One thing that making it mobile out is probably the most painful part of programming. The idea of trying to make everything look the same in different views…In relation to what you were describing about just the work in progress, it's interesting. I'm curious to hear more about that. It's just just how people respond to sites that are in progress, incomplete, or imperfect…how how does the audience understand that.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Are you exploring AI tools by any chance?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Ling</b><br>
            Yeah I am, in other projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            GitHub Copilot, I assume?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Ling</b><br>
            No actually, one of the recent project I've been doing with AI uses ChatGPT. It is still built on the web and it's still built using Node.js and things like that.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I'm doing a fellowship in Berkeley where it's all about working with AI tools and applying conceptual thinking into the process of working with technologies that are supposedly making our work faster and easier. So I started playing with Copilot from GitHub. Oh my God, I can't imagine going back to not working with AI, mainly because, when you want to merge two different codes, you have to test it and so on. How much time goes into that, and finding the good source to copy and paste to your website just to, at the end of the day, realize that it doesn't work with your programming language or the framework that you're using. So for me, it reduces like 4 hours of research per session, which is really crazy. But I've been trying to explore this idea of incompleteness in web design, like what does actually work in progress mean? And obviously it's very limited in imagining. In the sense it's like very useful for reducing the boring tasks, but otherwise a challenge to get very creative. I didn't want the topic to go into the direction of AI, but I just was curious if you had any similar opinions?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Ling</b><br>
            I haven't been using Copilot — I’m interested to see how it will work. What I've been doing with web design now is that, sometimes when I have tasks or things that I know that I can spend a little half an hour doing, I could just get ChatGPT to do it. So what I've been doing now is sometimes I would take a chunk of code and then tell ChatGPT that this is the issue. Go ahead, update it for me. What I've noticed is that it is honestly not that great. You can’t give it a very complex question. It wouldn’t understand. So you need to give it a chain of thoughts and things like that. I'm getting to the point where using ChatGPT for doing certain things, but if it is complex task, I wouldn't even bother honestly, I’d just do it by myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I wanted to say something about the mobile version…graphic designers who code tend to design from the mobile version and then expanded it into desktop. But for me, I have a freestyle graphic design background, so I always start from the desktop then shrink it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Ling</b><br>
            Me too!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I think that's architectural thinking right there. But then as I shrink the website, I just get rid of some components. I'm like, okay, you don't need to see this on mobile. I have one more question: How is the physical experience of the work going to be different from the online experience of the work? 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Ling</b><br>
            It's going to be definitely inherently different just because without in-person interacting with all the players, whereas the online one…if you imagine it happening in different parts of the world in different timezones, how do you even have a game together? One website that I really find inspiring which you might know, is a game of music making on a platform. Basically, it’s online real time game where you get to make music together with other people, up to eight people: <a href="https://plink.in/" target="_blank">https://plink.in/</a>. It's such a simple thing but it’s so interesting in a way that participation is, and it’s just beautifully designed in such a way that you cannot make a shitty music. So that's always been my reference how to create a real time game that enables people to play in such a natural way that it doesn't seem like forcing them to participate in the way that you want them to, but it's just natural.

        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            This is such a cool example. Something else that I'm exploring in my research is that technology can’t, is not designed, or meant to be a tool for the present moment. At least in web development, when you're thinking about archives, a website always refers to either a past or a future that it wants to inhabit, you know? So it's either speculative or has this crazy, rigid system of organization to preserve its, whatever, cultural and cultural heritage or whatever it is archiving. The present case examples function in a way that they promote in order to collect more of what will enter into its archive. But it's never really meant to be this tool I use to make something right now — and obviously social media platforms do that really well. I'm always on the lookout for these present moment websites. Thanks for sharing this.
