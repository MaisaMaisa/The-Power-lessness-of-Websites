            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I'm preparing this panel discussion revolving around websites as the dominant half of what entails the hybrid work. And that's a research continuation of the research that I started with Nadine where we were questioning what is the essence of the hybrid artwork? I'm more interested in the digital version of it and the dominance of the digital, post-pandemic reality. Why do we need to have a festival in order for certain digital works to come into existence? So there's this whole circulation that needs to happen for these works to be considered as artworks, digital artworks, and installations. Because otherwise, just in the context of the internet, they don't make it on the top of search results and they also don't get to be perceived as artworks. So we still need the human language and performance around them, for them to be considered as such. I was talking to Nikita and what they asked me to do is to make the panel discussion accessible because last year they had a lot of experts coming on stage. And for them, some of the topics were hardcore and somewhat inaccessible. So I was like: let's just talk about what we know in terms of websites, and it's amazing that you're joining me because you have experience, so you can elevate the discussion to go in that direction, you know? But I also want to make it accessible to artists who are not developing websites at all, because I do think that we all have something to say about them, as one of the main tools that we depend on and whether we use it consciously or not. Because we're going to have this written interview on the website, maybe let’s begin with the initial questions describing the project: what your project is about, why does it take the form of a website (instead of a book or a film), and how it will be exhibited during the festival? Let’s start one by one. Can you describe what the project is about?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Pablo</b><br>
            It's a research project speculating on chain of mutualist stores in Mexico City. So it's speculating on how system of really efficient economic nodes could work, but one that is also decentralized, locally owned by the neighbors, self-governed space of economic autonomy within the city that borrows some of the language of self-service convenience stores, which are huge in Mexico City. Have you been in Mexico?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I lived in Mexico City for five months.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Pablo</b><br>
            No way! Then you know about Oxxos, right?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Yeah, for sure.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Pablo</b><br>
            Oxxos are crazy and they're everywhere. There are more Oxxos in Mexico than there are McDonalds in the US.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            This is something I don't know.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Pablo</b><br>
            So I can tell you a bit about Oxxos because it's like a huge dialectic counter component of Pocas. Oxxos are the main self-service convenience stores in Mexico. They're owned by FEMSA, which is a mexican consortium which has the right to bottle Coca Cola in Mexico. So they're extremely wealthy. They're also patrons of art grants and stuff like that. So they are referenced and intertwined within the art world in Mexico. There are many of them. There are 20,000 Oxxos in the country, which is more than there are Subways in the US, more than McDonald’s — even though the U.S. is like three times larger.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            That's insane.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Pablo</b><br>
            It’s estimated that one Oxxo opens every day.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            One Oxxo per human.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Pablo</b><br>
            It's approaching insane levels of convenience. What's crazy about it is that they have really stepped up their interaction with urban economies, like you can pay your taxes in an Oxxo, so you can pay for all services, right? Like electricity, telephone, all of the stuff from your apartment. You can use it as a bank in many ways, like you can send money, receive money. There's an Oxxo debit card. So there's like a loyalty program. There's points that you can gather, you can buy a phone, right? You can buy a SIM card.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Can you fly with an Oxxo?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Pablo</b><br>
            You can buy bus tickets. You can buy plane tickets. Insane, right? And then, of course, as I said, snacks and drinks and all of that crap. They’re fundamental for urban life in Mexico City. They're open 24/7. So you're stopped by there when you're going to work. You know, commutes in Mexico City are very long. So they're an important gathering point in that regard. People who sell food like street vendors, they install themselves outside an Oxxo so there's also like a bit of a gradient towards the informal economy that also happens. So that's kind of an inspiration for Pocas. What I really want to is change the neoliberal capitalist values of that into post-capitalist mutualist values. How to do that is the project. And the thing is that I'm working with organizations at the intersection of software for alternative economies and self-organization. When I'm not doing art or whatever, I'm mostly doing design work for these kinds of organizations. I’m mostly working with ECSA, the Economic Space Agency and in a project called Neighborhoods Schools, developing software for groups in a framework called Holochain. I'm in the fringe of the peer-to-peer movement but also with a bit of the anti capitalistic crypto web3 people, which is weird. So it's a double sided project. I'm trying to make sense of all of that mess with a narrative that is easy to explain, that people can relate to, and also trying to map a bunch of projects in these spaces like distributed economies, distributed computing, alternative economies — and using Pocas like as an excuse to integrate projects and ideas from these projects. I'm interviewing people, trying to get feedback, trying to speculate on how real things working today can make Pocas possible. So it's not like a speculation as in in-the-future. Everything that the Pocas uses exists and it’s working. So the idea is that we could be doing this today. Why not? And it all lives on a website. That was a big introduction. I'm sorry.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            This is amazing. I'm already feeling like I should skip the boring questions that I prepared and go straight into responding. I went through the website and for me it's a documentation of the project, whether you're talking about a lot of existing systems that exist in real life but also in software and which we don't get to experience on Pocas’ website: <a href="https://pocas.store/" terget="_blank">https://pocas.store/</a> So is it a website in development? Do you make it accessible by using simple technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? Or do you want it to become a web3 interface where you have to mint crypto and you have to have currency in your wallet?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Pablo</b><br>
            This is a great question. Right now, Pocas is a project of science fiction, basically. And it's very superficial in that regard. It's a story. You visit the website and you have the documentation of this sort of systemic fiction that you engage with through…there are no characters, but the system is the character and you read it and it's kind of like a science fiction novel. That's very superficial and in that regard, the website is just making it accessible through, as you said, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Which I love, by the way. That’s my Holy Trinity. I work with those tools.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Pablo</b><br>
            Yeah, I use no frameworks. I code everything by hand. I suspect you do the same after seeing your websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Exactly. You inspected the code most probably, that's how you know.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Pablo</b><br>
            I did a bit and I also…just by the looks of it. This looks like made by someone who started from scratch. So, you know that most of the work that goes into website is care work. It’s just caring for it and nourishing it. So that's the stage with Pocas. I actually just made a huge update to the website a couple of hours ago. Not sure when you checked it, but it’s been updated. Right now it's very superficial, as I said, but my intention is to slowly flesh out some of these systems. So that the website that is only a surface starts to become real economic infrastructure for people to start their own local cooperatives. For that to take place, many things need to happen. And this is not that stage. But I do sort of envision a transition of the digital infrastructure from merely communicating to implementing some of these systems. And the idea is to do that through the feedback of the interviews, right? So in a way use fictioning and speculation as a serious way of developing systems. So what do we want to see? Let's build the systems for that, hoping that we create sort of the infrastructure for the life we want, basically.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I love that. Talking about the life that we want and letting the conversation feed into the technological system, you know. There’s this negotiation that really any tool cannot replace. It always speculates on the kinds of negotiations that people are going to have and then it assumes that that's the best way. That's why we're stuck in classification systems and content management systems that just use categories. And it's also okay to use existing tools — I do that a lot. But when there is a clear reason why it's used, and not when it directs people to…when it imposes itself for people to start using it and then to adjust their values in order to be able to use these systems. I love that. And who are you interviewing?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Pablo</b><br>
            These first interviews that I'm doing are with closer people. And I will expand that radius as I make more interviews. But I've been talking a lot with Jorge Lopez who is the main software engineer for the Economic Space Agency. He’s Mexican who’s been working on Post-Capitalist protocol with other members of ECSA for eight years, a bit less. It's really great because he both understands the culture of Mexico’s…very subtle things. Maybe you experience when you were there, but like informal economies, piracy. There's a very vibrant counter-economic environment that inspires Pocas. That's what I want to see. The infrastructure I would want to build is to support that, not to support businesses or corporations. So he understands that and he's also an engineer and he works in post-capitalist projects. So we've been having amazing conversations. So he's one. I'm also interviewing people from the groups I work with. So there's the liberator computing group — a new group that formed this year with members of the Crypto Commons Association. And I'm reviewing infrastructure stuff with them. Actually we’re going to record something soon. And there’s a few other people, but still uncertain if we will be able to have an interview. I hope I can have at least four interviews or maybe even five. Let's see how it goes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            How are you planning to exhibit the work during the festival? Because websites are a bit tricky for that. The default is just to put the screen somewhere with a mouse obviously. I'm based in L.A. right now and I was based in Amsterdam for ten years where the media art scene is, you know, still in development. In L.A. there is one, but everything revolves around all the paintings that exist in L.A., because L.A.’s art world is a big painting. So it's really funny to see artists put their websites in the context of an exhibition. The dominance of white galleries makes it very hard to present them in a way that it doesn't make them look like paintings, you know? And, you know, STRP is experimental and probably encourages going beyond the white gallery’s imposition.

        <p>
            <b>Pablo</b><br>
            Totally. But the challenge remains: How do you show something that is primarily a website? My strategy, and it's not very sophisticated I have to say, is just to sort of explode the website into the space. So parts of the website that I really like —> bring them to the physical world somehow. And mainly that is through the fabric prints that I’m doing. A lot of the work I do on Pocas is AI generated images. Partially, it just became a bit of an obsession. So I just generate so many images. So having some of them printed in fabric really, really helps. Screens are small, right? Even very big screens, they're small. Projection starts to become a different scale. And these fabrics have that scale similar to projection that is more similar to your body, which to me is important because then you can see the scale of the store as if it was the size it would be and relate to it differently. Then some people don't know if they are AI generated at the beginning and they have like this moment of doubt. Oh are these photographs? I think they're not. Are they? That moment for me is like: you doubted it, this could be real! The seed is planted that this could actually be there, right? A place where people do stuff and to me, generating that moment of doubt is powerful and the images help so much in that because you can then imagine yourself walking in this space or living in this space, doing something and that really rounds up the fantasy. So I'm printing a lot of images. I am showing different parts of the website on different screens. So there will be multiple screens. Some of them will show the interviews, some of them will show some organizational structures, some of them will be showing videos which are kind of inspired by the website, but not the website itself. So not all of the screens are interactive. So that’s the strategy and I use furniture from stores.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I love that. I'm a big fan of, I bet you are too, websites that are works in progress where you can sometimes even see a broken link or something that refers to its…What is actually under construction? There are a lot of websites that put the veil when there's maintenance mode or where there's construction and they just hide everything wrong that's happening on the websites. But I really love websites that expose that. And when you talk about putting it in a physical space, it also reflects on the website’s development. It's a fragmented representation — the furniture already suggests that the conversation continues, right? And also when you say how AI images  produce skepticism — I think that's a really strong. Generating images has become a normal user experience and a habit of many people. I always doubt whether an image is real or not. With any image, it doesn't matter if it's HQ or whatever. So I think it's super interesting to play with that. I have a lot of questions that are also coming from my web review of the website. Some links or  some hover effects don't let me read more when there is the read-more button. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Pablo</b><br>
            Those are probably broken. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I was wondering if that's intentional. Being a big fan of that (broken state), I hope that it is, but I can imagine that it's not.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Pablo</b><br>
            It’s not. It’s broken. It's just broken. On the diagram, you mean? I have to connect that to a documentation following after, but I haven't done it. So not intentional, it’s a broken link for now. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I think you can really own the story even if you don't have time to upgrade it until the festival.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Pablo</b><br>
            I really like the attitude you have towards it because it's more generative. I just gave up. I just assume that my websites are going to be broken. 
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Design-related question: I know you mentioned that it was led by the generation of images with AI but I bet that there is also some…you have a graphic design background, right?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Pablo</b><br>
            Kind of, yeah. I mean, I always studied digital media, but I mainly identify as a graphic designer who codes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Cool. So is the design that Pocas has right now something that came naturally to you or was it guided by AI and then the code? Which one was first?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Pablo</b><br>
            Good question. I think I started with the visual identity first and I just wanted to do ovals. I really like ovals and ellipses. There’s only one circle; you can only have one perfect circle, but you can have infinite different ovals. And I thought that was really beautiful. I wanted Pocas identity to be based on ovals of different shapes. To have them always be changing colors, to show this diversity of stores, and to be very bright. I'm exploring — this is not very developed in the work — using marketing as a strategy against capitalism. You're like fighting a monster, right? So this attention economy is absolutely relentless. So you have to be flashy. Post-capitalism has to be flashy and efficient and nice…
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            …and sexy.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Pablo</b><br>
            Yeah, sexy! It really has to compete against capitalism at the level of economic system. So I'm, I'm trying to present something that looks really fresh and fun. And then on the other side, there's the AI-image generation, with which I really want to make things that look lived, used and not clean and that they look like self-organized places I hang out in with my friends. Where I see self-organization taking place. These are not always clean.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Exactly.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Pablo</b><br>
            I'm really personally very bothered about depictions of the future that are super clean, you know, when you see these beautiful building with greenery and it’s new and I'm like: who was living there before? Was a community displaced for this utopia? What do these images imply, right? So for me, making images that look recycled, DIY is an important message regarding the use of resources, regarding displacement of communities, there are many things…So then there's those two layers, there's the messy AI-stuff and there's this sleek, clean, flashy design on top, which is what I would like to see in Pocas. That you have a digital layer that is clear, well-organized, that allows you to have legibility of that mess that can be more socially produced — chaotic, anarchic. And that we sort of leverage computation as a way to allow ourselves to be messy.
        </p>
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/dcd4b1ae-4d32-46a5-a746-b5b9111101cf/pocas_STRP_material-8.jpg?v=1712006451449">
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I love that! Self-organization is a messy concept in itself, it has life, life is messy in that sense. Everything that is not evacuates life, or history, or possibility for a collective future. I think that's also what is strongly present in your project. Maybe talking about the future of the project — is it digital or physical? If it's digital, what are the technical next steps for it to become a web3 software, for it to become a blockchain, decentralized platform…?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Pablo</b><br>
            I'll tell you a bit about the timeline. STRP is a huge turning point because it's what I regard as the first version of the documentation. So all of the systems described with picture will be at that stage. There will be already some interviews. I will continue doing interviews, maybe another five. And then we'll feedback into the text with those interviews and have a new version. And then I’ll stop for a bit. So I think that would take the rest of the year. And then the idea is to, next time I show Pocas, there has to be a system already working. Maybe there are still the images, the fabrics or stuff, but maybe there's an empty shelf, or a QR code and you can already sign in to a small app where you can exchange things in that shelf. For example clothes or someone brings a book and you take the book…So a small system where people can start to play. So I think that will take maybe next year at some point. And it mostly depends on the development of sort of these groups I'm working with. Where does it make sense to develop it? How close, how much of a prototype is it or how much of a serious thing is it? It depends on various factors, but my intention is for sure that I start to use art spaces, cultural spaces as a testing ground sandbox environment for post-capitalist economies. Because if you try to this outside and ask for a permit, it’s impossible. It's not going to happen. So I think the art world is a very, very good place to do that experiment, and for hiding behind that fact that it's just art. Which it is as well! So I hope I can have a shelf, maybe a fridge, and a very minimum viable system of mutual credit. That would be the area which is a particular way in which people can exchange goods and services without money. I'm hoping also to turn the project into a much more participatory one. Right now it’s very unilateral in a way that I control its aesthetics and its outputs. I would like that to change. So doing it more collaboratively, spending time with people who are interested and sort of testing and building these systems on site. That would be amazing.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            That's cool. I also have that struggle a lot. I'm based in two self-organized project spaces, one in Amsterdam, one in L.A. and obviously being the only web developer in both teams. I get to decide on everything when it comes to the website. I really want these websites to have more collective agency because now I'm their sovereign and I want to share my power or whatever. Are you planning to have an open-source code when it comes to that, like work with several developers on the foundation of the platform, or is it more collaborative in terms of design and the aesthetic?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Pablo</b><br>
            That's a good question. I think the ideal scenario to me looks like we develop a minimum version of focus in a hackathon or in a meeting with some of my friends from the Crypto Commons Association. So that it's like a more intensive work session where we come up with something that then I can work on myself if necessary. But that we get the major hurdles out together. And then I learn how to iterate on it with communities on site. So that's how I think it could work the best and the most efficient way. Otherwise you have to set up a whole infrastructure for code collaboration, like a proper GitHub and pull requests, and all of that.

            You need a startup basically.

            Yeah, and I don’t have time for that. I have too many things. I live a precarious life. The only way I would see these working out is in a more like hackathon, intensive session and then slowly working with friends and, of course, people should hopefully trace stuff out. But let's see, it's very early.

            I love that. I think it's great and it's going to be a successful project. I'm in the US so I use a lot of successful in my vocabulary. But when I'm in Europe, it vanishes. I have a final question: If I were to understand Pocas as a new blockchain system for centralized/decentralized, whatever people think of web3, online system, then are you aiming to propose it as an alternative blockchain system or is it more like relying on existing technologies? And if it is an alternative one, then what's wrong with the current or the existing ones?

            This is a huge can of worms, huge. I’m going to try to be efficient. So I would say that Pocas would be mostly a post-blockchain system, so not a blockchain internally. My perspective on that, this is like a common perspective from the progressive left wing and anarchist side of the Web3 space, is that blockchains are good for some things, but not for all things. Me personally, I’m more excited about peer-to-peer forms of local money first. So with your community, with people you trust and you encounter face to face, you don't necessarily need a global blockchain. You don't need to manage state globally. You can have a local chain. You can have a small accounting chain that is shared among the participants. And what I envision for the Pocas network is that it is actually not connected to the Internet, but running on a mesh network so that the Pocas store has a computer there, a node, and replicator like a Wi-Fi signal. And you connect to the Wi-Fi and your phones, through Bluetooth, also create a mesh network so that the network of the local of the Pocas is local to the space it is in. So it’s localized notion of computing. And then there are certain services where you would interact with blockchains. If you need to do the money stuff. That's what blockchains are very good for. When you need a global, trustless monetary system, financial services, that kind of things — Pocas needs to interface with that. But on the local side of it, I envision something that is much more peer-to-peer. That it’s not necessarily a need to spend a currency to do computing. Maybe it's more of like a solidarity computing network where we just run each other's computations. It would be very light, so there's no need to do massive computational stuff. So yeah, a post-blockchain system connected to the broader web3 when necessary, right? But as little as possible, I would say.

            I love that, my heart is melting. I also love that you add post- to it, post-blockchain. I would say about five years ago Web was booming with heavy websites and content management systems built on, for instance, Ruby on Rails. The harder the language, the better — a mentality which obviously breeds the tech-bro culture. But now it feels like there's this wave of cyberfeminist nostalgia coming in that is post web 2.0, but not Web 3.0. It is primarily using HTML, CSS, JavaScript — at least in my communities it feels like that web is again becoming accessible. Unfortunately, still in the art world. But there is also this counter-culture to the no-code movement in which I feel like the users are again starting to get a bit more interested in how code is functional and written — especially now that everything has been automated, specifically web design and computational images. Wow, thank you so much.
