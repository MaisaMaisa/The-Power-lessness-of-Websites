            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Can you describe what the project is about?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Bianca</b><br>
            The project brings a personal ritual I do when I find myself at the beach into the exhibition space. It’s a ritual about trust and letting go and I hope to share it with people that encounter my work at the festival by translating it into a digital installation. The project is also about the beauty of impermanence, which I feel is lost in the internet, where most things can be traced and found.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Why does it take the form of an installation (therefore has a physical experience) instead of an online game? 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Bianca</b><br>
            My practice started in online games, mostly out of necessity because I graduated in 2020 during the height of the COVID pandemic. I want to make my work more accessible in the physical environment, where people can simply encounter it by chance.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            How will it be exhibited during the festival?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Bianca</b><br>
            It’ll manifest as an interactive floor projection in the exhibition space.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Did you start developing the project from the memories of a ritual that needed to be translated into the digital? Or did you use digital tools to revive the memories? 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Bianca</b><br>
            I was at a beach in the Philippines when I was thinking of what to make for STRP festival. During sunset, I walked to the shore, did my usual ritual of drawing in the sand, and realized I’d like to recreate it for the festival. From there I started to think of different ways this might be possible — from a mechanical wavemaker and actual sand to interactive projection mapping.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Does the technology/project fill in for the lack of the beach, and therefore the ritual? 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Bianca</b><br>
            <span class="highlight">Yes. I thought of more literally bringing the elements of a shore into the exhibition space, like water and sand. Technology allows for a lighter experience while still capturing the ritual’s essence, in my opinion.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            What are some differences between the physical experience of the work and the fully virtual (spatial.io)? 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Bianca</b><br>
            The difference is in the way your full body can experience the work in the physical space, versus on the fully online experience, your interaction is limited to your eyes, ears and hands.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Do you refer to the project’s physical experience (such as STRP) on the spatial.io’s platform? 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Bianca</b><br>
            No. Although the same audio experienced in the physical installation at STRP can also be experienced online.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Is there anything that the technologies you use for the project didn’t succeed in bringing back from your ritual? If yes, what did this limitation enable? 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Bianca</b><br>
            With digital, I miss textures, the warmth of the sun, the smell of the ocean. I think this can be compensated, but in the next iteration.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            During the process of developing your work, did you enhance the experience of the ritual with technical capabilities or did you try to keep it as literal as possible? 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Bianca</b><br>
            I did play around with a different, more abstract way of executing this project, but I felt that a more literal interpretation would be more true to the experience. With most of my other work, it tends to work better for me to create a digital experience that’s different and more surreal than the experience in physical life. That’s what digital is good for after all. However, this project was an exception.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Any research questions that emerged from the development process?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Bianca</b><br>
            <span class="highlight">How can digital experiences reinforce lasting positive associations in people towards their environment, even after leaving the exhibition space?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            From a mental health perspective, what is the project’s main mission? 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Bianca</b><br>
            It’s to make a link between the physical and the psychological. I do believe this is what rituals are good for. Watching (a symbol of) your intentions get washed away by water and imagining the water taking them to where they need to go is a visual, visceral way of helping you feel more at ease and believe that things will be ok. Through experiencing this project, a person could start to associate seashores with this positive feeling. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Did the design or aesthetics follow from the interaction within the work, or were those decided on before developing the project?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Bianca</b><br>
            I had to decide between a few options. I could’ve made the visuals and interactions more abstract, but I felt that what this experience needed was a more realistic shore.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            What will be the project’s development state during the festival? Final? In progress?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Bianca</b><br>
            I believe that anything I make continues to be a work in progress..
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Is there some feedback to be collected from the festival that will feed into the future of the project? 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Bianca</b><br>
            I like to know how my work makes people feel before and after experiencing it.
