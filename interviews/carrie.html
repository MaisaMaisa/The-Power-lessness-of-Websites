            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I’m interested in human relationships with technology, but more specifically how web developers perceive humans and therefore translate them into users, so how does the process of translation from physical to digital happen. More recently, since I've been exploring AI a little bit like in my coding practice, I've been curious about how AI perceives humans and then codes / develops the user. For STRP panel discussion, I’m making this website that doesn't really make sense if if it only exists in the context of the internet, so it needs the human to be activated. And only then you would understand why some elements are part of it. Also because I need to do a lot of preparation for the stage to prevent detouring from the topic, and websites really help me for that — they keep me, you know, grounded. And then I was like, since it’s a hybrid art festival, I should make the panel discussion hybrid as well. So in anticipation to the event happening, I want to collect this digital archive, which contains the interviews with artists and then I will highlight some of the keynotes that we will again bring back to the panel discussion. Since the panel discussion is about websites, I'm specifically interested in a website as the dominant half of what entails a hybrid artwork. Since I'm closely looking at the process of translation, from analog to digital, I'm specifically interested, especially when it comes to your work (which is related to the field of psychology), how do we start ideating in the post-pandemic reality? Is it with the digital framework embedded in the imagination, or is the digital a successor of the existing imagination? And then of course, what happens in this translation? Do things get lost? I think I'm going to start with some initial questions just to get to know your project a bit, which I already know, but since it's going to be archived…and then we can dive more into the specific questions that I have in relation to the digital presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            Cool. Sounds perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            The first three questions are: Can you describe what the project is about? Why does it take the form of a website instead of a book or a film? And how will it be exhibited during the festival? And I can repeat the questions if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            The project is a 3D animation and quite different from the previous works that I've ever made, which are almost like moving paintings set within singular scenes thinking about art history, self-representation and digital avatars…This new work is very removed from representations of self. Instead it'll be more sequential in a more narrative-driven way in the format of a promotional video for a near future child daycare center. I originally wanted to create a sci-fi, futuristic, type of environment, but then I thought it would be more interesting to set in the near future with familiarity and nostalgia, rather than overly polished and unrelatable.The narrator's voice in the animation attempts to market this daycare to its potential audience, which are wealthy parents of preschool kids. The daycare, which I call “Tomorrow’s Promise” offers glimpses of their child’s future potential in a growth-driven society, and sells the experience as beneficial to both child and parent. It's a place for children to play, learn, socialize, but also where all of their activities are monitored by the team behind the daycare center and provided as data to the parents. The caregivers at the daycare…I assume they all have psychology masters degrees.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I love this condition.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            Cameras are located in each room, gathering data from how the children are playing and interacting with one another. I'm going to make a few more scenes of exclusive add-ons that parents can purchase at this daycare like <i>Test Your Child's Future Career</i>. This was partially inspired by a tradition called “Zhua Zhou” in China where when your child turns one year old, parents place a variety of objects in front of them for them to crawl towards one that interests them, as a predictor for their future career path. Objects range from a calculator, a spoon, to a cake or a computer mouse in today’s practice. The kid will just sit there and look at all of them. And then whichever one the kid crawls to…if the kid crawls towards a computer mouse, then the prediction is: oh, your child chose his future and he wants to be a computer scientist. Obviously they aren’t choosing this out of rationality, it's just whatever seems interesting to them, you know, in the moment. I think this tradition is something that is more for the parents, as if when your child chooses this object, then they have this natural inclination to be this specific type of person. Many parents today don’t take the prediction too seriously, but some may still push their kid to actually follow this prediction: “if my kid chooses a computer mouse, then I need to get them to be good at math and coding and send them to training schools and tutoring programs.” Similarly, this new animation uses the act of play as a device to think about how we, as caretakers and people with power, measure children's success and future potential.<span class="highlight">…And how, as a society, we're making play productive. Play is such a joyful, imaginative and freeing type of human experience, but increasingly we’re seeing the commodification of it.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I love that.
        </p>
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/dcd4b1ae-4d32-46a5-a746-b5b9111101cf/Screenshot%202024-03-26%20at%201.52.32%E2%80%AFPM.png?v=1712620043449">
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            I’m also thinking about my own personal experience growing up between America and China,  and the thin lines between care and control. Oftentimes care turns into control. In undergrad, I studied Art History and Applied Psychology, and I was part of a research team called The Science of Human Connections at NYU led by Dr. Niobe Way. We studied qualitative, longitudinal data tracking the development of Chinese students from elementary school to high school. I was not only fascinated by the research but also by the perspective of a researcher, what questions were asked, what interview methods were used, and how behaviors were observed. This project visualizes this sort of process in a humorous and surreal way through the perspective of the daycare center trying to commodify this type of research. <br><br>
            
            Historically in the US, children played in a big field and then the radius got smaller and smaller with technological development. So children were then limited to the front lawn in front of their home. And then when video games came out, children started just playing in their bedrooms. And then now with so many digital things available for children to play, they're confined to their phone or other digital devices. But another way of seeing this is also that the radius of play is infinite now. I'm also thinking about how technology is influencing this play.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I love how you merge art history and psychology. What is your role in that project? You know, because you're not critiquing directly, but obviously you're observing and you're critical of the shifts of what it means to be an observer or like a psychologist. When it comes to art creation…As artists we can be flexible to put ourselves in this active agent role or also in just visualizing or in just measuring for further research. And since you also mentioned the measuring of play and commodification of the whatever is extracted like the data, I assume I was wondering if you apply that method also in your project and I guess that also relates to its future. If the project will have another iteration, is there going to be some feedback extracted that you will need and what would that look like for the future iteration?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            When I originally proposed this idea, I wanted to have an interactive element with cameras in the physical installation. Currently, the installation that we're planning is just a projector of the video on a wall and maybe some spatial design like some carpet that mimics the feeling of a daycare center. Perhaps tints on the windows so that it's more colorful and evocative of a place where play happens, but at the same time, a little bit absurd as well. An extension to this concept would be to have cameras in the space that track participants in real-time. I imagine having a ball pit pool with where people can jump in, and monitors surrounding them that track their facial expressions and give them career and personality predictions. This person could be an astronaut. That person could be a doctor. You probably would be a chef though, you know how to cook.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Definitely. I revealed this information last time. Yeah, that's cool.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            If there was more opportunities in the future, I would want to shape them in that direction.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I think you mentioned that it's going to be in New Art City. So can you talk a bit more about that translation?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            In New Art City, I'm planning on taking existing spaces from 3D animation. So that could be like a playroom, or reading room, and nap room and putting them in New Art City. So there will be spaces that are similar to the ones in the 3D animation. I'm thinking of it almost like a virtual tour of the daycare centers also from the perspective of the owner of this center.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            So New Art City is mainly for 3D spaces that primarily function as artworks, right? I haven't really interacted so much with the works on the platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            Yeah, they're really amazing. They are a gallery run by an incredible team, and also work with schools and educators. They showcase a variety of exhibitions and works, ranging from 3D, video, audio, and embedded links and portals. I love them.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            When you make it on New Art City, are you also referring STRP and that it is an installation that exists in the physical or that also has a physical component to it? Or does it exist on its own, therefore that it only has the context of the internet sort of?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            Oh, interesting. My idea is to create a corresponding virtual relation to the physical one. In the physical space we are either planning on having monitors set up, or a playable build of the virtual exhibition with game controllers in space. I'm still deciding and depending on how much time I have. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            That's cool. I know it's still in development how you're going to experience it both virtually and physically…But do you have any key differences to share between the two formats?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            In the virtual space, I feel like there's opportunity for unexpected engagement because of the gaming aspect and “playing” through the simulated playgrounds. The virtual space offers that potential to experience the installation, engage with the objects that are represented in the 3D animation, and get close to the camera.<span class="highlight"> I can embed interesting details in the virtual space that signal this idea of child’s play, but also really push the idea of how these organizations, research centers are packaging childhood experiences.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I was also curious about your technical process in relation to remembering. Did you start the project with very sharp memories that became active agents in you developing new rules or conditions for the near-future day care center design? Or did you use technology and digital tools to revive certain memories?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            That's a great question. The way I work is really introspective and I'm the type who often re-visits memories. In the past year I was working on a series called Eye Exercise, and the process brought back a lot of memories from my experience being a foreigner attending an elementary school in Shanghai. Specifically, how care and control were intertwined in classrooms settings, especially in the eye exercise practice as an example. To give some context, it was mandatory for students to follow a set of guided eye massages every day to help with eye strain. I still ended up with glasses, so it didn’t work.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            It was a myth.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            Yes, researchers later found that it actually was potentially even worse for eyes because children wouldn’t wash their hands before touching their eyes…So it just wasn't the best.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            But was it just like massaging them literally? Or is it creating certain eye movements?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            There's four parts to the routine where you massage pressure points around the eye. It's a national standard. I can demonstrate… I just thought it was so funny that it didn’t work but it’s still in use today in schools.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            That's so funny.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            There would be “star students” who were selected by the teachers, basically the teacher's pet, who were exempt from doing the exercise. So they would walk around and point at people who were doing it incorrectly or being lazy. It’s quite absurd and is encoded with a certain power dynamic and system of control through the lens of care. 
        </p>
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/dcd4b1ae-4d32-46a5-a746-b5b9111101cf/Screenshot%202024-04-06%20at%2011.55.06%E2%80%AFAM.png?v=1712620058690">
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            It makes me wonder about…what if that ritual, the eye rolling, would just vanish, then what would take place instead of that? You already mentioned that they just changed the exercise and that it was still related to eyesight and vision. But then if they had to just remove completely the focus on eyes, there would have to be something else taking place. Would the state break down? I'm imagining all the disasters that'd come out of that.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            They might use infrared eye masks.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            It points to a tradition that has been maintained for years and years and years. And it's part of the history which is so hard to just remove, even if it doesn't do any good for anyone. And it also doesn't do harm…
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            Most people want their children to be successful, to have great careers, so they can lead secure lives, move on the social ladder, and benefit society at large. This encourages education, and motivates privileged families to send their children to gifted daycares, or after-class tutors…as an investment in the betterment of their child's future. Part of it is rooted in love and care, but there's also a capitalistic drive to have kids “reach their full potential” and play an efficient role in society. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I love that your project is questioning the boundaries between care and control. It's so obvious but I never thought about the thin line so clearly. From my experience of being a kid and raised by my parents, it thought: if you control me, you don't care about me. We grow up learning that there is no simple breakdown of how one migrates into another or how one feeds the other. I'm doing this fellowship in Berkeley about AI technologies that aims to apply conceptual thinking into the process of working with AI technologies. One of the fellows is a mother of two, three kids, and two of them are teenagers. And then she was showing us her app…I don't know if you looked into these like technologies for tracking kids, but they're really absurd. I can't remember what exactly shocked me about it, but she could obviously see where her kids are. But it also had this kind of system that would somehow clock in if her teenage son went to class or not. And I can't remember exactly how the technology does it, but it was constantly extracting and measuring whether or not they actually were in school or if if they were somewhere else. We were asking her if they tried to hack the app…When I was looking at the interface showing a kid’s profile it almost looked like old-school Facebook profile but with different kind of metrics. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            In China there's WeChat, which is chat-based app, that also includes almost every aspect of life, from ordering food to calling a cab. It's such a centralized platform. But at the same time, each class nowadays has a WeChat chat group with all the parents and teachers, where they'll announce children’s exam scores and call out class behavior publicly. I’ve heard some classes have livestreams as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I was also shocked to find out about https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ in the US. It's so awkward. I was like, some kids are really mean. I guess what's great about these sort of technologies is our response. That’s kind of what you’re strongly working with, obviously not proposing anything as a should, but allowing that space for users to evaluate their own boundaries in that sense.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            Definitely. And I think it's also just like questioning the idea of optimization because we're trying to optimize outcomes for children as members of the society, by presenting them with an ideal goal and urging them to reach that.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            And then also like if they do then for them to prove that they reached certain goals, they need to have this like whole data history. And then does that data history actually mean success of that role?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            Like, does it?
