            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I’m interested in human relationships with technology, but more specifically how web developers perceive humans and therefore translate them into users, so how does the process of translation from physical to digital happen. More recently, since I've been exploring AI a little bit in my coding practice, I've been curious about how AI perceives humans and then codes / develops the user. For STRP panel discussion, I’m making this website that doesn't really make sense if it only exists in the context of the internet, so it needs the human to be activated. And only then would you understand why some elements are part of it. Also because I need to do a lot of preparation for the stage to prevent detouring from the topic, and websites really help me for that — they keep me, you know, grounded. And then I was like, since it’s a hybrid art festival, I should make the panel discussion hybrid as well. So in anticipation to the event happening, I want to collect this digital archive, which contains the interviews with artists and then I will highlight some of the keynotes that we will bring back to the panel discussion. Since the panel discussion is about websites, I'm specifically interested in a website as the dominant half of what entails a hybrid artwork. Since I'm closely looking at the process of translation, from analog to digital, I'm specifically interested, especially when it comes to your work (which is related to the field of psychology), how do we start ideating in the post-pandemic reality? Is it with the digital framework embedded in the imagination, or is the digital a successor of the existing imagination? And then of course, what happens in this translation? Do things get lost? I think I'm going to start with some initial questions just to get to know your project a bit, which I already know, but since it's going to be archived…and then we can dive more into the specific questions that I have in relation to the digital presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            Cool. Sounds perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            The first three questions are: Can you describe what the project is about? Why does it take the form of a website instead of a book or a film? And how will it be exhibited during the festival? And I can repeat the questions if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            The project is basically a 3D animation and it be quite a different piece than the previous works that I've ever made, because my previous pieces are almost like moving paintings and they’re singular scenes with various elements. And I'm thinking about art history and thinking about self-representation and like the digital world and avatars…This piece is very removed from representations of myself. Instead it'll be, I wouldn't say narrative, but more sequential in the sense that there's like scenes after scenes. And it's going to be the format of this almost like promotional video for a futuristic, not futuristic, but near future child day care center. So the center itself is…I originally wanted it to be more like sci-fi futuristic, but then I thought it would be more interesting to set in the near future where things almost look nostalgic, other than perfectly polished. That was my original concept, but now that I'm working on it more and more, I'm leaning more towards my own childhood memories of what a day care looks like. So in the film, in the video, basically it's the narrator's voice that's going to easily sell this daycare to its potential audience, which is parents. It’s seeing the future of their children's potential basically. So it's a place for children to play, they can learn, they can socialize. And all of that is being monitored by the team behind the daycare center. So the caregivers, I assume that they all have psychology degrees.

            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I love this condition.

        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            And they have cameras in each room that are observing the children. And those cameras are gathering data from how the children are playing or interacting with one another. And there's also…I'm going to make a few more scenes of specialized add-ons that parents can purchase at this daycare like Test Your Child's Future Career. And this is off of an ancient tradition in a lot of Asian countries. China and Korea both have this practice where when your kid turns one year old, there's a practice called [ draw drow ]. And what that means is you place your kid in front of a variety of objects, like the calculator, like a spoon, like a cake or like a computer mouse. This is the modern version, obviously. And the kid will just sit there and look at all of them. And then whichever one the kid crawls to…if the kid crawls towards a computer mouse, then the prediction is: oh, your child chose his future and he wants to be a computer scientist. This is not choosing this out of rationality it’s just whatever seems interesting to that, you know, in the moment. This practice is something that is more for the parents. It's kind of like fiction that, oh, this child chose this object, which means that they have this natural inclination to be the type of that person. The parents having that information will…some of them won't take it seriously. They know it's just a tradition. But others might actually push their kid to do it. Oh, my kid needs to be a computer scientist. I need to get them to be good at math and coding and send them to training schools. The whole concept that's behind this video is thinking about how we measure children's success through play.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I love that.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            …And how, as a society, we're making play productive, where play is such a human experience. It should be freeing and it should be just careless, like carefree play. But increasingly I'm seeing the commodification of different types of human experiences and play being one of them. And even in LA, I see these schools opening up for children…I passed by the school that was called School of Entrepreneurship for Children, something like that. And they sell fashion design classes to kids, like teach your child how to create their own label!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>

        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            I’m also thinking about my own personal experience growing up between America and China, which is found through all of my work. But in this one specifically, its focus is on just the experience of being a child in different places. Obviously in both places I'm being observed because I'm in this place of control which could be under the disguise of care. Like schools…Obviously, teachers should care about their students, but the care and control boundary I feel like is quite thin. Oftentimes care turns into control. Which is really interesting in retrospect, thinking back to my own experiences, but also in undergrad, I studied art history and psychology as you know. And I was in a research team called The Science of Human Connections at NYU. And it was led by Dr. Niobe Way. And I was part of a study that was looking at qualitative longitudinal data comparing Chinese students to American students through, I think it was like 12 years or something. So every year the researchers would go to China and interview the same kids over and over again to track their development. They would also interview the teachers and their parents. So it was quite holistic in terms of tracing how the child develops. And there were so many things that I learned not only about this direct comparison between how children develop between these two countries, but also the perspective of a researcher, what questions were asked, what methods of inquiry reviews — what questions they ask. They were really informative in thinking about this project too. So some of the scenes in the video are just children in rooms with like one way mirror so the researchers are behind the mirror and then the child is probably like reading a book or playing with another caretaker from the other side. And it's visualizing this sort of observation. I'm kind of making it also a little bit humorous because it's not going to be from the perspective of a specific child. It's going to be from the perspective of the daycare center trying to commodify this…I think the work is really thinking about what is a commodification of children's play, and I feel like that's a shift increasingly towards capitalism. In the past children played on grass and children would play in their neighborhood with friends, which still happens today…But there was a book that I read [ I don't remember the name — I can send it ], it was talking about children's radius of play in the United States. Historically, children would play in a big field and then the radius got smaller and smaller with technological development. So children were then limited to the front lawn in front of their home. And then when video games came out, children started just playing in their bedrooms. And then now with so many digital things available for children to play, they're obviously just confined to their phone or the computer, just sitting there. But another way of seeing this is also that the radius of play is infinite now. I'm also thinking about how technology is influencing this play.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I love how you merge art history and psychology. What is your role in that project? You're not critiquing directly, but you’re obviously observing and you're critical of the shifts of what it means to be an observer or a psychologist. When it comes to art creation…As artists we can be flexible to put ourselves in this active agent role, or also in just visualizing, or in just measuring for further research. And since you also mentioned the measuring of play and commodification of the whatever is extracted, like the data, I was wondering what happens if you apply that method also in your project, which I guess also relates to its future. If the project will have another iteration, is there going to be some feedback extracted that you will need and what would that look like for the future iteration?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            When I originally pitched this idea, I wanted to have like an interactive element with cameras in the physical installation. Currently, the installation that we're planning is just a projector of the video on a wall and maybe some spatial design like some carpet that mimics the feeling of a daycare center. Maybe tints on the windows so that it's more colorful and evocative of a place where play happens, but at the same time, a little bit absurd as well. But originally I was thinking of having cameras in the space and even having a pool with plastic balls where people can jump in and maybe surrounding them through monitors or some more extensive like installation design that really is bringing playground elements into the physical space where the cameras would also be looking at the participants who are like in the space, tracking data, giving them career, evaluations…Maybe you should be an astronaut. You should be a chief. You probably are a chief though, you know how to cook.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            Definitely. I revealed this information last time. Yeah, that's cool.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            If there was more opportunities in the future, I would want to shape them in that direction.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I think you mentioned that it's going to be in New Art City. So can you talk a bit more about that translation?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            In New Art City, I'm planning on taking existing spaces from 3D animation. So that could be like a playroom, or reading room, and nap room and putting them in New Art City. So there will be spaces that are similar to the ones in the 3D animation. I'm thinking of it almost like a virtual tour of the daycare centers also from the perspective of the owner of this center.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            So New Art City is mainly for 3D spaces that primarily function as artworks, right? I haven't really interacted so much with the works on the platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            Yeah, they're really amazing. They kind of position themselves as a gallery. They also work with schools. I teach at USC and had the class exhibition hosted on their website, so they have both parts of: more commercial side and then also more nonprofit educational side, which is great. I think primarily it’s 3D works, but you can embed links. You can add sound audio. There's some like interaction…It’s kind of like Mozilla hubs but more on the media art side and it's also I think well curated. They don't just, you know, open the space up to anybody. But if you have a project that sits with, you know, the galleries ethos and everything, they're really open. I love them.

        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            When you make it on New Art City, are you also referring STRP and that it is an installation that exists in the physical or that also has a physical component to it? Or does it exist on its own, therefore that it only has the context of the internet sort of?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            Oh, interesting. My idea is to sort of have the title and include the festival and this would be corresponding virtual relation to the physical one. And I think in the physical space we were either planning on having like a monitor set up, so people can access the virtual exhibition. Or I could record a screen recording of me for the virtual space and then having a play on the big projector after the recording. I’m still deciding. The third idea is to actually have a playable build of the virtual exhibition and game controllers in space. But I'm still deciding and depending on how much time I have. But either way there will be some form of the virtual exhibition in the space.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            That's cool. I know it's still in development how you're going to experience it both virtually and physically…But do you have any key differences to share between the two formats?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            Definitely in the virtual space, I feel like there's even more opportunity for engagement because, entering this digital exhibition which is like a tour of the space where you can navigate and play yeah, I'm playing, I play. The gaming aspect also ties into it a bit because the format is like a game and walking through the space, which I'm also super interested in. I feel like if I had more budget and time, I would really want to create more in the physical space and really tie that in. I think for now, like the virtual space really offers that potential to play through the space, engage with the objects that are represented in the 3D animation like the ball pit or the yard. And you can get really close to the camera. I can put a lot of interesting things in the virtual space that signal this idea of child’s play, but also really push the idea of how these organizations, research centers are packaging childhood experiences. I feel like the virtual space is going to just offer a lot more potential to explore the world that I'm building and the image I'm trying to say, and in the physical space, I'm going to try my best to create this environment. The very ideal scenario would be to like completely replicate things from virtual space. I'm already happy that I can sort of take a stab at it in that form.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I was also curious about your technical process in relation to remembering. Did you start the project with very sharp memories that became active agents in you developing new rules or conditions for the near-future day care center design? Or did you use technology and digital tools to revive certain memories?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            Oh, that's a great question. The way I work is really introspective and I think I'm someone who just goes back to memories, maybe because I'm nostalgic or I just always like to flip through…Especially because in the past year I was working on a series called Eye Exercise. I was thinking about specifically my experience as an American attending school where it was mandatory to do a set of eye exercises every single day. Eye exercise is like massaging pressure points around your eye and they say that it helps relieve eye’s drain and it's a nationwide practice. I went to a public school in China where this was practiced and I still ended up with glasses, so it didn’t work.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            It was a myth.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            Yeah, researchers later found that it actually was potentially even worse for eyes because children wouldn’t wash their hands before touching their eyes…So it just wasn't the best.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            But was it just like massaging them literally? Or is it creating certain eye movements?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            There are four steps. So this is the first one, these two points you have to press with your thumbs. Then there’s one where you have to use your index and thumb…this is one…It's just a ubiquitous practice, but I just thought it was so funny that it didn’t work but they're still doing it today in schools. Some cities actually read the research and knew that this hand massage method was not effective. So these were more absurd eye exercise, which is rolling your eyes…But it's like structured, they count the beats, like one, two, three, and then you have to roll your eyes in different directions.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            That's so funny.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            And there would be a star student who was selected by the teacher, basically the teachers pet who was exempt from doing the exercise. So they would walk around and point out people who weren't doing it correctly. So I think thinking about the absurdity how as a kid I listen to what the adults are telling me. You’re telling me to do this for my own benefit, in hopes that the future of my vision will be clear, but clearly it’s not. So now I'm just stepping back even more and thinking about my children and looking at children today. And also, like seeing it as a metaphor for just people in general, in societies and with technologies. How are we looking after people and caring for them? But at the same time, it's also definitely a form of control and not everything is revealed. I think children can be a metaphor for people in general, who are under systems of control. It’s definitely coming from like a humorous perspective, but I think the implications are quite rich.

        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            It makes me wonder about…what if that ritual, the eye rolling, would just vanish, then what would take place instead of that? You already mentioned that they just changed the exercise and that it was still related to eyesight and vision. But then if they had to completely remove the focus on eyes, there would have to be something else taking place. Would the state break down? I'm imagining all the disasters that'd come out of that.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            They might do infrared eye masks.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            It points to a tradition that has been maintained for years and years and years. And it's part of the history which is so hard to just remove, even if it doesn't do any good for anyone. And it also doesn't do harm…
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Carrie</b><br>
            Thinking about this in capitalism, I see society's making strategic investments in human capital. For kids it's like: oh, we want you to be successful. We want you to have great careers. So they can benefit society at large. It's encouraging education. It's encouraging people who come from privilege to send their children to different sort of gifted daycares, or different schools, or better…just for the betterment of their child's future. Part of it is care, they’re trying to be as successful as they can, but there's also a capitalistic drive for humans to whatever it means to reach their full potential and play an efficient role in society. That's also something that relates to many parts of this.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maisa</b><br>
            I love that your project is questioning the boundaries between care and control. It's so obvious but I never thought about the thin line so clearly. From my experience of being a kid and raised by my parents, I thought: if you control me, you don't care about me. We grow up learning that there is no simple breakdown of how one migrates into another or how one feeds the other. I'm doing this fellowship in Berkeley about AI technologies that aims to apply conceptual thinking into the process of working with AI technologies. One of the fellows is a mother of two, three kids, and two of them are teenagers. And then she was showing us her app…I don't know if you looked into these like technologies for tracking kids, but they're really absurd. I can't remember what exactly shocked me about it, but she could obviously see where her kids are. It also had this kind of system that would somehow clock in if her teenage son went to class or not. And I can't remember exactly how the technology does it, but it was constantly extracting and measuring whether or not they actually were in school or if if they were somewhere else. We were asking her if they tried to hack the app…When I was looking at the interface showing a kid’s profile it almost looked like old-school Facebook profile but with different kind of metrics.

            I know in China there's WeChat, which is chat-based app, but also includes basically every aspect of life in China. You can pay things, you can call the car, whatever you want. It's such a centralized platform. But at the same time, each class has like a WeChat chat group with all the parents, all the teachers, and they'll announce children like exam scores publicly in the chat where all the parents and all the kids can see it. It’s pretty brutal.

            I was also shocked to find out about https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ in the US. It's so awkward. I was like, some kids are really mean. I guess what's great about these sort of technologies is our response. That’s kind of what you’re strongly working with, obviously not proposing anything as a should, but allowing that space for users to evaluate their own boundaries in that sense.

            Definitely. And I think it's also just like questioning the idea of optimization because we're trying to optimize outcomes for children as members of the society, by presenting them with an ideal goal and urging them to reach that.

            And then if they do then for them to prove that they reached certain goals, they need to have this whole data history. And then the question becomes if that data history actually means success of that role?
